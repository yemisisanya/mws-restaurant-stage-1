#### _Stage 1 Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, in stage 1, I have converted a static webpage to a mobile-friendly design and I have also added accessibility for screen reader use. The page is responsive on different sized displays and a service worker as been added for offline experience. 


### How to install?

1. Start off by cloning or downloading the repository in the top righ corner. In a terminal on your computer, navigate to directory/folder

2. In the folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, to view the responsive site.
